When developing your project it is mandatory to be more efficient as it possible. As the brooks law states:
As more people are contributing to the work, less productive the project dev goes.


In order for your OSS project to be more famous and more succesful, you must follow some tips.
For example:
  -> As more people get interested into your project you must state your requirements.
  -> Create a website where non developer people can easily find all your information. Important, not to make One size fit all website,
    as you must divide your target into developers who can contribute or people who want to use your project for their personal use.
  -> Message forum is imporant to be in touch with your contributors or users.
  -> Control your version, do not use same version all the time
  -> Track your bugs, and fix them. Open a ticket, discuss with the commiters and as long as you find and fix the bug close the ticket.
  -> Live chatting system may be useful when dealing with a lot of users
  -> Use wiki to state your documenation and more information about your projects.
  -> If it is possible translate your project into several languages, so more users can find and use it
  -> Be social...
