Goals: 
  -> Release Numbering
  -> Release Branches
  -> Release Stabilize
  -> Pacakging 
  -> Testing and Releasing
  -> Supporting your old versions
  -> Daily Dev
  
  
  What are release:
    -> As long as you have project, it can be tedious to make it perfect from the first reslease of your project. During development
    you can make lots of mistakes, and you want to fix them. As you long you fix your project, you must rerelease it with different numbering.
    For example:
      v1.0.0 Means your first release
      As long as you fixed the bug or changed some features
      v1.1.0 or v2.0.0 and so on.
    Releasing numbering may differ, it can be Scanley and Singer type. Scanely type: 2.3 and Singer: 5.11.4
    
    There are some types of release components:
    -> Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 1) 
    -> Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 2) 
    -> Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 3)
     major.minor.micro
    
    Stable, Unstable, Development, RC (Release Candidate)
    
    
Packaging:
  -> Is the traditional form of distribution of free software is source code. 
  Basic Standards:
    -> Format
    -> Name and Layout
    -> Compilation and Installion
    -> Binary Packages
    
    
    -> Format:
      -> Source code must be provided within a standard format that maintains a directory tree
         For example: compress, gzip, bzip etc
    -> Name and Layout:
      -> Package name: Software name + Release number 
         Example:  Scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz
         
     -> Compilation and Installation:
        -> Must describe compilation and istallation method to users:
           For example: Unix users must use  " sudo apt-get install Scanley-2.5.0 " 
      
     Binary Packages:
        -> Using docker make binary packages...
        
        
 Your project must feel as best-out-of-box experience. It is when you buy or install some new game to your pc, you anticipate it to be great
 and it is great...
