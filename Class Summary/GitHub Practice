You can find the proper documenation of GitHub or Git usage in their original documentation website.
For GitHub: 
  -> https://docs.github.com/en/rest
For Git:
  -> https://git-scm.com/doc
  
Tip:
  -> You can use GitHub own website or Git API. It depends on your own prefernces. For me, it is more interesting and more joyable to use
  Git API, as it is faster and more convinient. However, if you are not familiar with Git API or you do not want to spend your time for learning
  GIT, you can easily use GitHub...
