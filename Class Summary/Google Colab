Google Colab:
  -> With Colab you can import an image dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, all in just a few lines of code. 
     Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, 
     including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. All you need is a browser.
